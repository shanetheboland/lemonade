# Lemonade

Keeps track of when you pee.

A simple app I built while learning React and Redux.

*Demo:* Nope, havenâ€™t set up hosting yet.

## Run this project locally

```
$ git@github.com:shanetheboland/lemonade.git
$ cd lemonade
$ npm install
```

## Global NPM Modules

You'll need this global NPM module:

```
$ npm install -g xo nodemon
```

## Scripts

### Development
Nodemon monitors all serverside changes and will automatically restart your Node server anytime a change is made. It ignores changes made to the `frontend/` folder. All Javascript in the `frontend/scripts/` folder is built using Webpack to the `public/javascripts/main.js` file. All Sass in the `frontend/styles` is built using Webpack to the `public/stylesheets/main.css` file. It utilizes Hot Module Reloading in development. To build your JS/CSS and run your server run:

```
$ npm run start-dev
```
### Linting
Linting is done using XO. It's integrated to lint code in the frontend in the webpack development file while running in your dev environment. To run a manual lint that also checks server files:

```
$ npm run lint
```

Built using:
